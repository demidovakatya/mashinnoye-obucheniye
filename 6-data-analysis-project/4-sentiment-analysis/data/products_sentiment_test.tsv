0	so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? size [ + 2 ] # # because , unless it 's small , i won 't cary it around .
1	3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze . 
2	better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .
3	6 . play gameboy color games on it with goboy .
4	likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too .
5	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs . 
6	i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut .
7	styling / ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little ' braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn. must be paid when dialing .
8	at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well . 
9	- light , compact design 
10	although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall .
11	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . 
12	i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great .
13	the user support service isn 't too great either .
14	the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .
15	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 . 
16	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static . 
17	unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later .
18	i love this camera . 
19	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . 
20	battery life is good for a phone of this size . 
21	as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market .
22	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal . 
23	pros.1.speed 2 . signal strength 3.advanced configuration options
24	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) 
25	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem . 
26	i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it !
27	but i had to give you four because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow .
28	i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else .
29	the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year .
30	if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .
31	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well . 
32	i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks !
33	third , the poor design continues with the case . 
34	i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it .
35	overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet * knocks on wood * .
36	it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a " normal " compression mode . and , it has the 3x zoom .
37	the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will .
38	( you can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby . ) also , we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the diaper genie ) .
39	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr . 
40	the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust .
41	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had . 
42	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution . 
43	amazon is awaesome ! 
44	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod . 
45	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough . 
46	1 ) price / gb of storage 
47	it wouldn 't always work seemlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .
48	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . 
49	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages . 
50	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio . 
51	i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . 
52	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did . 
53	with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . 
54	i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues .
55	though nearly a dozen different people at both t-mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices .
56	in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep .
57	only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth .
58	the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones . [ t ]
59	so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! 
60	if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now .
61	what i dont like : nothing much except headphones , belt clip design .
62	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ... 
63	the tech support is worthless too .
64	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
65	well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) . 
66	i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . 
67	if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .
68	its nice look is also a plus .
69	it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course .
70	the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .
71	important to note that what i really needed was an access point as my dsl modem already does the router thing and i have a wired 100m network round the house. setup [ -1 ] # # setting up the system was not too complicated .
72	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine . 
73	also , when i dial an " 800 " number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu .
74	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . 
75	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more . 
76	saw the hitachi on amazon.com with their $ 25.00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out .
77	i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . 
78	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection . 
79	like other reviewers , installation was hell . 
80	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com 
81	applications : it has lots of applications and they work very well ... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open .
82	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment . 
83	it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths .
84	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! 
85	but , i would definately recommend this phone . 
86	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic . 
87	ok , not quite everything ... but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it .
88	honestly , i love this player . 
89	do n't buy this player . 
90	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson .
91	putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .
92	the price is $ ... more .
93	i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) . 
94	after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine .
95	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! 
96	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets . 
97	another plus in my book , no file limits ! 
98	the pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .
99	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful . 
100	sound quality ? phenomenal .
101	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . 
102	t610 supports only midi files .
103	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range . 
104	i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue .
105	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . 
106	ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved .
107	the i-pod is the best thing i have ever used .
108	the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice .
109	i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud .
110	if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth .
111	the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight .
112	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling . 
113	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . 
114	i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned .
115	i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .
116	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com. 
117	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . 
118	best electronic i 've bought since i was born . 
119	imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest fm signals in my area .
120	i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive . 
121	3 . bags are easy to change .
122	got way too many blurry pictures . 
123	looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors . 
124	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . 
125	tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent . 
126	tough as nails .
127	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
128	apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs $ 100 !
129	nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .
130	the soft start is nice .
131	now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will !
132	the battery is nice . 
133	itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site .
134	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class . 
135	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . 
136	durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .
137	what a disappointment ! 
138	there will be much erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters .
139	this is a great camera for you ! 
140	absolutely no problems with this router .
141	video recording is limited at just 9 seconds .
142	well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more .
143	on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside . 
144	good quality video . 
145	great camera , great investment ! 
146	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through . 
147	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . 
148	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple . 
149	you can use the obex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into konqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone .
150	especially the bluetooth server ... meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .
151	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
152	fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car sterio fm tunner latest find : connected this baby to my $ 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .
153	a wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose ! ! !
154	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want . 
155	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! 
156	the ones i 've kept ( porter cables , dewalts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router .
157	five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .
158	for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit .
159	i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views .
160	once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working .
161	the radio feature has superb sound quality . 
162	finally , i gave up and i purchased a router razier .
163	they last about 1 1 / 2 years until the problems start .
164	what impressed me most was the sound .
165	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all . 
166	a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering .
167	photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one .. even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
168	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . 
169	4 . the build is just right .
170	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . 
171	i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .
172	but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .
173	finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! 
174	oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^ 
175	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches . 
176	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some . 
177	i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .
178	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too . 
179	the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got .
180	i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out- well , just be prepared .
181	sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good .
182	then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely .
183	i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected ! ) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it .
184	creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . .
185	well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry .
186	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad . 
187	the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .
188	installation was as near automatic as can be .
189	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use . 
190	no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .
191	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
192	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both . 
193	another 5 star performance .
194	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best . 
195	so for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models i 've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & i like that .
196	what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has .
197	the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent .
198	2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information . 
199	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
200	the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk .
201	i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! )
202	there seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router .
203	another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily .
204	what i like the most : - small and solid feel .
205	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since . 
206	10 great price for all the features . 
207	i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .
208	the only problem is the size of the keys .
209	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . 
210	i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems .
211	upside : this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ) .
212	( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) * easy one-hand use * impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare--and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag .
213	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off . 
214	for the price i don 't think you can beat it .
215	pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all .
216	most of the other players i checked dont have user servicable battery .
217	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . 
218	works great ! 
219	door broke after a month . 
220	the buttons and interface are very easy to use . 
221	very good " every day " camera . fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos .
222	it all sounds great too .
223	its compact and has rounded edges .
224	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more . 
225	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well . 
226	the only reason for not giving it 5 stars : the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6-8 hours at most .
227	the downside being that the tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g .
228	it is nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options .
229	this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . 
230	it 's so cute ... and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue .
231	poor visibility on the keys . 
232	the software , which comes with player is not good at all . 
233	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . 
234	also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs .
235	the touch pad does take a little getting used to .
236	i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills .
237	value : comparing data storage with price . 
238	ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone i have owned .
239	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all . 
240	i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking ) .
241	it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket .
242	the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia .
243	the player itself has all sorts of problems . 
244	these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .
245	i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it ! 
246	travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
247	i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time .
248	after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures .
249	it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .
250	just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
251	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical . 
252	this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks .
253	i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone .
254	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . 
255	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . 
256	look at the size of it !
257	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately . 
258	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes . 
259	but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 mp camera .
260	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement . 
261	the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob .
262	is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ?
263	great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ) .
264	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed . 
265	# # cons . 1. configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.lousy initial software 3 . does not work with bitspirit with upnp , besides that its an excellent choice , if you know your way around network configuration go for it .
266	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . 
267	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market . 
268	the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving .
269	i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .
270	8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company vpn at 56k speed via bluetooth .
271	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? 
272	after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .
273	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . 
274	however , i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec .
275	i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $ 300 speedmatic because he saw what this router can do .
276	two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well .
277	you just can 't go wrong with this one !
278	i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )
279	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . 
280	this is also the case with nis 2004 .
281	they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .
282	memory / storage - seemingly boundless .
283	i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time .
284	update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! 
285	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . 
286	the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it .
287	the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up . 
288	a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it .
289	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
290	i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good .
291	the metal housing seems very rugged .
292	again , this is a design flaw in the headphone !
293	the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality .
294	the service from t-mobile is very good too . 
295	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . 
296	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . 
297	definetely a great camera . 
298	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome . 
299	the diaper champ is the best !
300	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
301	8mb for a camera like this is a joke . 
302	i like the size and weight of this little critter . 
303	7- 360  panoramic pictures are a very big deal .
304	if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time . .
305	but it wouldn 't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn 't stop with the alerts .
306	i am glad that i do not work for norton .
307	pros : large hard drive for the $ $ -- 20gb and 40gb are both affordable .
308	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . 
309	the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 
310	new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration .
311	the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod .
312	the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive .
313	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
314	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . 
315	so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .
316	excellent diaper disposal unit .
317	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . 
318	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera .
319	this one is particularly bothersome : allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another .
320	well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! 
321	as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains .
322	i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product !
323	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . 
324	i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell !
325	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera . 
326	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software . 
327	piii 1ghz 512mb rdram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble .
328	the digital zoom is crap .
329	best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .
330	for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player .
331	you willdefinitly appreciate the small size .
332	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard . 
333	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) . 
334	this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do .
335	the battery life on this phone is surreal . 
336	this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it .
337	this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature . 
338	good looks 
339	the vibrate setting is loud ! 
340	for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .
341	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . 
342	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them . 
343	the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .
344	very smal .
345	i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $ $ $ , it was definitely worth it .
346	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport . 
347	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . 
348	and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its ' own .
349	the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .
350	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there . 
351	my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites .
352	i 've had no problems with the software . 
353	customer service : awful . listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier .
354	update ( march 2005 ) : my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby : - )
355	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money . 
356	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap . 
357	so , right out of the box i had issue .
358	it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review .
359	i didn 't have any major problems installing this software .
360	the radio and voice recording are nice .
361	it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ?
362	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy . 
363	this unit comes with the usb / firewire cable as a standard item now .
364	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . 
365	so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos . 
366	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch . 
367	power for the tech-savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate .
368	the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .
369	games-- not really important , but existant
370	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . 
371	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small . 
372	we can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third-party " iskin " protective covers for an extra thirty bucks .
373	the setup and transfer process was cake for me . 
374	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call . 
375	well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn 't working right and once again , after consulting customer se !
376	i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .
377	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . 
378	the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated .
379	verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game .
380	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . 
381	unfortunately , the touch-pad issues [ non-intuitive ] and poor instruction guide killed it .
382	i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speedboost router .
383	so-so 1 . customer service - 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent .
384	the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having .
385	i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .
386	however , this product performed well below my expectation .
387	it will not replace your high-end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots .
388	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods . 
389	and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .
390	im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )
391	i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well .
392	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price . 
393	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product . 
394	apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc .
395	for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player . 
396	canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
397	wish i could give it 4 1 / 2 stars .
398	it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song " piece of cr-- ! " , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to .
399	my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic .
400	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see . 
401	it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish .
402	i really have no complaints over this unit . 
403	i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required " permissions " and lacked proper administrator status .
404	+ battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [ requires a windows pc ] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet + awesome sound quality ... i mean it is creative right ?
405	also , with one click you can help train your spam killer .
406	now this router is not the cheapest on the market .
407	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on ... literally !
408	smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one .
409	i 'd give it 4.5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .
410	it was no problem for me to use their software . 
411	i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed .
412	the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10 , it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast .
413	the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service .
414	putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything ( unless the hold feature is improved : it asks if you want to " unhold " for every button up press ) second , i 'm worried about the durability of the player .
415	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . 
416	purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever .
417	without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 
418	the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! 
419	i then realized a major design flaw .
420	the panorama modes are wonderful .
421	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be . 
422	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take . 
423	it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .
424	for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .
425	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! 
426	c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer . 
427	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . 
428	when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin .
429	actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .
430	the camera responce is very quick .
431	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
432	the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
433	i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium-ion battery , an ac / dc power adapter , a usb 2.0 cable , a belt-clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick-start guide , and creative mediasource software .
434	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod . 
435	initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .
436	the program is called gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does .
437	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . 
438	as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep .
439	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players 
440	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . 
441	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . 
442	i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons .
443	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
444	then , my ad / pop-up blocking was completely gone .
445	i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit .
446	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . 
447	the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds .
448	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags . 
449	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . 
450	buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .
451	i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .
452	there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
453	a digic ii-powered image-processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start-up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition .
454	i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .
455	to set up the xbox , wap , and ethernest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins .
456	don 't worry this player rocks .
457	this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .
458	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) . 
459	i was a little disappointed in the low end . 
460	the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .
461	it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! ) .
462	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice . 
463	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . 
464	the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rpms of the speed settings were mentioned .
465	but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record .
466	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
467	the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with .
468	the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
469	since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .
470	excellent range of metering options as well . 
471	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market . 
472	proven canon built quality and lens . 
473	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) . 
474	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it ! 
475	i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .
476	bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck !
477	excellent sound i mean the player has juice .
478	however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every-day use .
479	it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . 
480	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems . 
481	his is what i get for my $ 200 on this mp3 player ?
482	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . 
483	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
484	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . 
485	the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
486	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera . 
487	this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing .
488	if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while .
489	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands . 
490	even with the waterproof housing it is small .
491	this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope .
492	i recently had to run a 3 / 4 " straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn 't even slow down .
493	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad . 
494	but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .
495	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . 
496	it 's a very intuitive program . 
497	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . 
498	it films 10 second video , for crying out loud .
499	everything shines of quality .
