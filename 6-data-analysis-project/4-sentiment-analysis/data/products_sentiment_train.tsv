2 . take around 10,000 640x480 pictures .	1
i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ez firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again .	1
the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case .	1
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured ; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders .	0
i was using the cheapie pail ... and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart .	1
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . 	1
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 	1
from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1 / 4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .	1
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood . 	1
whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get !	1
takes excellent photos . 	1
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to . 	1
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras . 	0
i love this phone .	1
i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non-tech customer service ( tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzac ) or they have a $ 30 tech-support number .	0
i replaced it with a router raizer and it works much better .	0
it 's being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers ( headphone jack , player locking up , etc ) .	1
the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it .	1
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $ 500 price tag and get a quality camera .	1
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light . 	1
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . 	0
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . 	0
do n't buy this player . 	0
size - bigger than the ipod 	0
the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder .	0
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . 	1
the grain was terrible . 	0
another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function .	0
bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .	1
this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attactive hi-tech casing .	1
i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . 	0
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better . 	1
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily . 	1
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and / or groups is really cool .	1
avoid this product at all costs .	0
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection . 	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package . 	1
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby . 	1
smooth plunging ! ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w / lubricant .	1
-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library . 	0
the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy .	1
the customer support is pathetic .	0
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .	1
right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .	1
i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection .	0
it works with a minimum of fuss .	1
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens .	0
the prints are beautiful ! 	1
finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music .	1
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 	1
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . 	0
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it .	1
what i really like about- its quite , it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking .	1
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 	1
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .	1
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route . 	1
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . 	1
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .	0
whatever ... on to the negatives : -touchy about charging ... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .	0
it has a classic design yet looks hip . 	1
sound : this is where i love zen the most .	1
i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus !	1
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . 	1
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . 	1
seems to work great .	1
very simple and painless .	1
2 ) scroll button / switch 	0
the collet for the 1 / 4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out .	0
( batteries last longer too ! ) 	1
you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ .	1
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it . 	1
the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too ; they look as though they were built out of legos .	0
i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years .	1
the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .	1
i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .	1
no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find !	1
get it , it 's woth every penny ! ! 	1
e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 	0
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless .	0
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 	1
from day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , long shutdowns due to " ccapp.exe " program running which is a norton program .	0
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 	0
you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .	1
in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece .	0
the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 	0
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . 	0
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) . 	1
the only complaint i have is that the 1 / 4 " collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 / 4 " bits .	0
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . 	0
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 	1
the interface is simple to use .	1
interface - practically seamless . 	1
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . 	1
this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .	0
friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .	1
this is ridiculous . 	0
have had the player since xmass and love it ! 	1
this product has virtually all the same installation problems .	0
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options . 	1
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price . 	1
after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available . 	0
my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made .	0
many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . 	0
typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . 	0
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . 	0
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 . 	1
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 	1
they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . 	0
at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all !	1
if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd recomment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $ 15 dollors i think ) .	1
it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcafee anti-virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems .	1
it 's faster than wmp .	1
however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all .	1
for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .	0
after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window .	0
the great and versatile ipod i love my ipod !	1
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . 	1
among my requirments for a phone were : good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support .	1
diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail !	1
it 's far better than all others on the market .	1
because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product . 	0
i never had a single problem .	1
its really cool . 	1
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . 	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability . 	1
i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly .	1
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing . 	1
the two-times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off .	1
this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240 .	1
this phone is one of the best i 've ever used .	1
eball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .	1
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .	1
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs . 	1
it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . 	0
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work . 	0
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 	1
the os is abit confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve !	0
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . 	1
second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating .	0
few month ago , it 's very popular among my community .	1
there are no specail bags to deal with or buy !	1
it 's oval and ... nice .	1
the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle .	1
finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost / gb , and also consider ease of use .	1
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . 	0
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .	0
i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks .	1
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . 	0
no matter the format . 	1
7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 	0
unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type . 	0
the biggest problem is the installation .	0
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! 	1
i did like the heft of the machine .	1
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records . 	1
i purchased two of these beauties .	1
luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger .	0
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 	0
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . 	0
if , like me you simply want an ipod to play your mp3 's , buy this one .	1
dont rely on t-mobile rebates .	0
the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .	1
other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use .	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 	0
we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .	1
but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100 .	1
- audio formats : supports both mp3 , wma ... and yeah , wav too .	1
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall . 	0
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual . 	1
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the ' zen micro ' has to offer .	1
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market . 	1
many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all > i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well .	0
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . 	0
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .	1
overall , a good buy for the price . 	1
my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor . 	0
these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one .	1
first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor .	1
have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t-mobile .	1
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . 	0
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . 	0
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 	1
looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .	0
we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only .	0
builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes .	1
but canon never fails to amaze . 	1
i am an advanced computer user , so i cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work !	0
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . 	1
i got it working fast enough .	1
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera . 	1
i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it . 	1
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! ! 	1
even the instruction booklet is out of order .	0
if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else .	1
3660 had similar features , but that is big in size .	1
( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) 	1
this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device .	1
i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price . 	1
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). 	1
i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality .	1
i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use .	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 	0
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included . 	0
the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . 	0
sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6.0 " adjust levels " function ... not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though .	0
this thing is trash . 	0
the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . 	0
so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .	1
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck . 	1
the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc . 	0
i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions .	0
great design-- very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( vertal ones are the only competition ) ; and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus .	1
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 	1
the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full .	0
2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception .	1
however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .	1
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name . 	0
about the product : the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to " hip " youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the " awkward " factor .	1
* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models . 	0
my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything .	0
i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy .	0
can 't get easier than that !	0
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . 	1
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone .	1
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .	1
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . 	1
also included in the " games " section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs .	1
and we still love it !	1
the door would not close . 	0
all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera .	0
the popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses .	1
we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $ 6.00 for a year of bags- can 't beat that ! !	1
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today . 	0
controls are a bit awkward . 	0
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . 	1
i gave up and got a diaper dekor .	0
but it ; you won 't regret it .	1
this is an excellent router for the price .	1
on my main computer the software did not work right . 	0
the phone itself is pretty nice .	1
perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways .	1
- no propietary headset jack 	0
you must keep double checking depths .	0
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games . 	1
who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . 	0
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . 	1
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " . 	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem .. 	0
sometimes , various applications crash .	0
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . 	0
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player . 	0
there 's even an equalizer ( under " settings " ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , " deep " , and electronic .	1
the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! )	1
the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly .	1
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . 	1
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome . 	1
as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .	1
it also has unproven battery life . 	0
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking . 	0
my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above .	0
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 	1
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 	1
however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- do not purchase this product .	0
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .	1
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . 	0
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . 	1
i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorrola ) it might be good .... but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one .	0
white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag .	1
i 've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever .	1
i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application .	0
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . 	1
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . 	0
moving on to sound department ... it delivers !	1
the blue backlight is pretty cool .	1
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going . 	0
our norton internet / av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if sytemworks is ok now , it should remain ok .	0
for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it .	0
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . 	1
overall build quality , good macros-results , impressive video-quality , good pictures with flash ( good colours , sharp results ) , excellent auto white balance .	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . 	1
the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .	0
every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . 	0
i think the interface is great .	1
when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera ist top notch and very impressive .	1
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 	1
respectable , solid , but not awe-inspiring .	0
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead . 	0
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature . 	1
no way to contact their customer service . 	0
the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding .	0
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . 	1
but , for the money it is a good machine .	1
i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . 	1
-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ). 	0
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! 	1
the phone is sturdy .	1
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . 	0
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and ofcourse the built in camera .	1
other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better .	0
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player . 	1
other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod . 	1
again , every review written about the tech line is true ... after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .	0
i highly recommend it . 	1
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 	0
t-mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate .	0
just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date . 	1
i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors .	1
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered . 	1
with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more . 	1
it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc . 	0
i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it .	1
all the " cool " features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 .	1
even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity .	1
nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . 	1
its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 ... so with all that said , buy the router ! ! ! !	1
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from .	1
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive . 	1
plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great .	1
nis 2003 worked like a charm last year .	1
to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid .	0
there are 2 things that need fixing first is the battery life . it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons .	0
the dvd player does not work properly . 	0
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly . 	1
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) . 	0
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . 	1
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior . 	1
you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so .	0
the sound is quite good , in terms of volume .	1
( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell . even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see-through ? ) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full .	0
this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( espcially windows -- ugh ... )	0
it is the ' first generation ' of the player , and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck .	0
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .	0
first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc .	1
it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music .	0
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . 	0
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .	1
ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) . 	1
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . 	1
i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . 	1
the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's $ 25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to toolseeker.com and it tells you )	1
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 	1
my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long .	0
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users .	1
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . 	1
only problem is that is a bit heavy .	0
very cool features ... great camera with zoom ... cool quality pictures ... great ringtones ... bluetooth feature is great ....	1
this one has a good looking .	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty . 	0
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .	1
this camera is so easy to use !	1
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera .. 	1
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) . 	1
in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software 	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . 	0
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! 	1
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) . 	0
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .	1
also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones .	0
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything . 	1
the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .	1
) button sensitivity : even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive .	0
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors . 	1
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad . 	1
neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings .	1
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift . 	0
loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well . 	0
great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great .	1
start up is so quick !	1
ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good . 	1
clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! ! !	1
i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless .	1
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . 	0
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .	1
in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . 	1
i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go .... which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $ 14.95 flat fee .	1
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results . 	1
the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 	0
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died . 	0
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that . 	0
i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits .	0
6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . 	0
but the major problem i had was with the software . 	0
i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 	1
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want . 	1
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones . 	1
i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . 	0
apex sucks ! 	0
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . 	1
7 picture quality is excellent . 	1
the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and powerfull headphones , and of course the player .	1
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . 	1
i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .	0
yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone .	0
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to . 	1
it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera .	1
and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags !	1
the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .	1
i love the eos based controls and easy menus . 	1
supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone .	1
fm radio built in ( howard stern ) .	1
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files . 	1
as it turns out , this is an awesome camera !	1
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc . 	0
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing . 	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into . 	1
i click pictures in jpg format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .	1
it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow .	1
after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up .	0
an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook .	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . 	1
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . 	0
the quality is superb . 	1
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 	1
this player is an ideal purchase . 	1
my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be .	0
i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the cmt people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed .	1
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd . 	0
other than that this thing is great ... 	1
in my table the m12v has been a real champ .	1
the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog .	1
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .	1
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited . 	1
overall , a very disappointing product . 	0
creative did an awesome job with the design .	1
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera . 	1
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion .	1
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . 	1
the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . 	0
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require !	1
. lens cap is a really annoying 	0
this is a fantastic tool to use .	1
at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph .	1
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability . 	1
the software you get with this camera is perfect . 	1
it definitely keeps the smell out .	1
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception . 	1
apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services .	0
it is a very amazing product . 	1
the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers .	1
learning how to use it will not take very long . 	1
this phone is fantastic .	1
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . 	0
for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it . 	0
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 	1
this makes for a great phone .	1
the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use .	1
other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans .	1
there is no odor and extremely easy to use .	1
i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature .	0
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freakin ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! !	0
2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select . 	0
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . 	0
best phone i 've ever owned , period .	1
then sorting the files is easy as pie . 	1
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . 	0
i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it .	0
yes , i recommend it over the competition . 	1
when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .	0
they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $ 15 to " handle " and ship a cd ? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails .	0
really easy to use .	1
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . 	1
this is a well-made and powerful tool .	1
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away . 	1
* price and capacity 	1
i was some what sceptical when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible hp .	0
about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . 	0
all in all i am pleased with the router .	1
the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function .	0
it 's so small .	1
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . 	1
the g3 looks like a work of art ! 	1
i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software / hardware .	0
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package . 	1
freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful .	1
noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah . 	1
for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .	0
its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been moreso if it could be preset .	1
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . 	1
nothing but hassle with this company . 	0
to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , ... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted .	0
looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive .	0
the sound from the player is ok . 	1
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones . 	1
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . 	1
it does take some getting used to .	0
in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution .	1
all in all , this is a great phone .	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes . 	1
i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone .	0
have a great and easy to use bundled software	1
holy cow ! it really does scratch easily !	0
3 . play java games on it .	1
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . 	1
the battery life lastes 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs ) , etc .	1
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 	1
i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances .	1
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . 	1
they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy . 	0
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that . 	0
this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .	0
i can only hear the sound but no picture ! 	0
this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router .	1
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . " 	0
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping . 	1
songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .	1
the phone is small , light , and very attractive . 	1
however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . 	1
the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over .	1
i 'd say that this camera is perfect .	1
made the camera totally inoperable . 	0
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . 	0
the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing .	1
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite .	1
we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail !	1
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box . 	1
the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . 	0
- replaceable battery .	1
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .	0
take quick pictures with excelent resolution	1
flawless .	1
no line out jack - as i said , there is none . 	0
however , the creative software is not real intuitive . 	0
3 . it never smelled - at all .	1
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 	0
this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . 	0
i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .	1
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations . 	1
unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 	0
after two weeks the picture kept freezing . 	0
i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven 't tried the 1 / 4 " sleeve yet ) .	1
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .	1
its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .	1
it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .	1
cons : no am / fm radio tuner-- something a large number of competetors are doing	0
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it . 	1
both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best .	0
the storage capacity is great for me -- 	1
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd . 	0
it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too .	1
first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $ 300 myself .	0
- radio quality : weak reception	0
the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy = good , but it 's always hard to tell these days ) .	1
you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too . 	1
diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first .	0
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider .	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 	1
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .	1
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . 	0
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . 	1
there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) . 	0
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization . 	1
this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways ... i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .	1
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy . 	1
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 	1
weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . 	0
i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 	1
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . 	0
it 's good .	1
it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up .	0
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds . 	1
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 	1
love the speaker phone .	1
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot . 	0
very bad quality . 	0
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days !	0
im at full capacity ! ! ! ! i called symantic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $ 35 / hr to help ! ! i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill i hung up !	0
i love this camera .	1
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents . 	1
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . 	0
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! 	1
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . 	1
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . 	1
the good : 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution .	1
the router works fine for both wired and wireless .	1
i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special " diaper " trash bags necessary .	1
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's . 	1
6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . 	0
it is small . 	1
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich . 	1
especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around .	1
i downloaded this set from norton , and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download .	0
i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up .	0
seriously ! i love it ! 	1
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations .	0
within one month , my player completely died .	0
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . 	1
there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact .	1
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . 	1
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . 	0
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . 	0
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . 	0
this time , it started the uninstallation process , then i left for work . i think it will work . i hope it will work .	0
very simple to use . 	1
the camera has a wonderful set of features . 	1
i didnt have any installation problems ; and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate .	1
it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in ' shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very well in general .	0
i 'm really happy with this purchase . 	1
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .	1
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to . 	1
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide . 	1
the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder .	1
also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston .	0
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 	0
minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . 	0
functionality , menus are easy to navigate ... as many have mentioned , the touch pads take some time to get used to , but i 've gotten used to it .	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 	1
i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs .	1
i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 	0
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy . 	0
i like the speakphone function a lot . 	1
i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it .	1
* the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily .	0
a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go .. the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it .	0
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve . 	1
the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value .	0
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated . 	1
i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple .	1
no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .	1
the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area .	0
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive . 	1
there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't .	0
otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player .	1
it sure does ! 	1
utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list .	1
2- excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! ! !	1
there isn 't much features on the ipod at all , except games .	0
that is , you cannot access the internet at all .	0
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price . 	1
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped . 	0
i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper ; and i needed to be able to use wma files .	1
2 ) the champ uses regular store bags .	1
also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up .	0
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well .	1
the file ripping / transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use .	1
the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed . 	0
much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate 	1
the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet .	0
not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . 	1
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple . 	1
i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills .	1
fm receiver - it has none . 	0
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better . 	1
i simply love this feature . 	1
after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself ) .	0
t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . 	1
the sound is great , the portability , etc ... all the " stuff " you expect from a good mp-3 player , this zen micro has it .	1
the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . 	1
the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .	1
also , very light and portable . 	1
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line . 	1
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . 	0
as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on .	0
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . 	1
hold button-- suprisingly not all mp3s have this ; this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket .	1
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .	1
if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you !	1
where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ) .	0
personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .	1
the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect .	1
also much less stinky .	0
* slick-looking design and improved interface 	1
the battery has a long life .	1
the interface took a little getting used to .	0
the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly .	1
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 	0
on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade .	1
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good . 	0
i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic ) .	1
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very ' potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .	1
i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked .	0
the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion .	1
this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . 	1
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . 	0
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . 	1
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 	1
it 's easy . 	1
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints . 	1
software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . 	0
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take. 	1
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . 	1
the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .	1
- excellent sound quality 	1
4- looks great .	1
creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices .	1
this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers .	1
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . 	1
it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .	1
hard drive screws up occasionally	0
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ) .	1
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 	1
works great , no odor , and uses regular bags .	1
d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on 	0
i must have gotten a good one .	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! 	1
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary .	1
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed . 	0
in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge .	0
transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .	1
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone . 	1
the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .	1
as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems .	1
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? ) , should have equal priority .	0
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be	1
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . 	1
this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem . 	1
i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable .	1
transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy . 	1
we 've never experienced odor from the pail .	1
mixed bag i guess but the price was right . 	1
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . 	0
if you have an older version of " internet security " installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .	0
the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least . 	0
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .	0
the flash is very weak .	0
i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended .	1
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc. 	1
at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated .	0
great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous .	1
only one disk played through to completion successfully . 	0
well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! !	1
other than that , i think it is the best router for the money .	1
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! 	1
they obviously have quality and reliability problems .	0
i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! ! !	1
-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best . 	0
the picturers are amazing . 	1
reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing .	1
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . 	1
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual . 	1
as said before this works perfectly . 	1
all at the same time , and all without a hitch .	1
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100 .	1
i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it .	1
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable .	1
* i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable .	0
this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .	1
while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch .	0
this is a wonderful camera . 	1
the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) . 	1
once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and windoctor ) .	1
the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with . 	1
on the t-mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a t-mobile tzone ( usually a major city ) .	1
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .	1
limitations : - not a lot of original accessories like the ipod .	0
a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .	1
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well . 	0
it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .	1
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up . 	1
i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down .	1
its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market .	1
if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly $ 105.50 per minute and blame you for " abusing " your ipod .	0
it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere .	1
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc. 	1
diaper champ is great .	1
i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size . 	0
even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys .	1
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 	0
and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy . 	1
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance . 	0
however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup .	0
the only problem is the battery life .	0
however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn 't work at all in the car , for example .	0
it also holds a lot more diapers .	1
booting up my computer took forever ! ! !	0
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click . 	1
the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17 .	0
i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .	1
other than that , the simbian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it .	1
the camera and video functionality is decent , i can 't see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will .	1
this is a great diaper pail .	1
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size . 	1
nokia does not disappoint in this model . 	1
its not a perfect system but its a very good one .	1
it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it . 	0
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . 	1
i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities .	1
mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much .	0
with the plungelift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on / off controls ) .	0
i upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results .	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 	0
for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod .	1
this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .	0
the inital setup of the router was simple .	1
the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect .	1
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .	1
the earbud headphones are really nice .	1
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 	1
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 	0
i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much .	0
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . 	0
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! 	1
stay away from this product !	0
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .	1
this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 	1
the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. . 	0
3 ) 4x zoom is nice 	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother . 	1
i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt .	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc . 	1
1 ) the champ is easy to use .	1
2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 	0
i would however highly recommend the m12v router !	1
i mean , they 're short !	0
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . 	1
since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works .	0
1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . 	0
less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer .	1
the setup software did everything .	1
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! !	0
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . 	1
-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks . 	0
4 . play n-gage games on it .	1
i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow - i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all .	1
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 	1
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it . 	1
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . 	1
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .	1
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over ( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used goback ) .	0
5 . check traffic411.com for la traffic on the 405 .	1
it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram ) .	0
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time . 	1
we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used .	0
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low . 	0
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice . 	1
it is a nice router in all ways but one .	1
well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze . 	0
even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life !	1
- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . 	1
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast .	0
i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . 	0
the sound quality is very good . 	1
it would not hang up on calls .	0
one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing . 	0
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face .	0
with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long .	1
can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .	1
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . 	1
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird . 	0
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have . 	1
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches .	0
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks . 	0
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 	1
this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online .	0
it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black .	1
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned . 	1
some features that the ' zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive ... actually an sd flash card drive ... very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $ 40 to buy vs .	1
i love the performance and features of this router .	1
sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .	1
if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading	1
as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage .	0
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet . 	1
another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! 	1
the manual is excellent .	1
+ screen was good , easy to read 	1
great screen and great sound . 	1
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 	1
i highly recommend this phone .	1
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) . 	1
i use it on a router table , and it is works well .	1
if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version .	0
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .	0
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out . 	1
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .	1
we constantly got " windows virtual memory low " error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and / or crashes .	0
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . 	1
goes ~ 3 days after a charge .	1
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. . 	1
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 	1
and it is very easy to clean .	1
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is . 	1
the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . 	0
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .	1
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 	1
this product is too fragile for normal use . 	0
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 	1
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . 	1
only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .	0
i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time !	0
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .	0
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .	1
sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) . 	1
it has everything i needed : bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a good operating system with lots of supporting software .	1
the m12v has been great .	1
* lens visible in optical viewfinder . 	0
and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative .	0
even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with " mac settings " , etc .	0
although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there .	0
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out . 	0
thank you apple ! you make fabulous products .	1
it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot .	1
either way , can 't go wrong with this price . 	1
i 'm not sure why all the bad reviews , my computer isn 't especially slowed down and i have win ' 98 .	1
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .	1
) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; this baby plays wmas too .	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email . 	1
price ! 	1
great phone .. . 	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel . 	1
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . 	1
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . 	1
finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . 	1
for a sleeker , smaller and more " average " mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful .	1
the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .	1
first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates .	0
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . 	0
loved the slim design . 	1
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing . 	0
also , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree .	1
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead . 	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate . 	1
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 	1
smooth plunging mechanism .	1
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . 	1
- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . 	0
- solid , high-quality construction 	1
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini .	1
also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; it is definitely an added plus .	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime . 	1
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it . 	1
it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .	1
overall it is a great value .	1
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . 	0
usb 2.0 - very fast 	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 	1
as a loyal customer of norton / symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating ) .	0
5 stars all the way !	1
on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem .	0
. itunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program ; usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .	1
now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again .	0
could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over iso100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefacts , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizing while video-playback , better video comression ( smaler viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight .	1
multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone .	1
it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there . 	1
i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .	1
who in the hell needs a frigging * vga * camera on their cellphone ? ? ?	0
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . 	1
the product i rate five stars ,	1
2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . 	1
so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine . 	1
this is the mp3 player with everything i need . as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied .	1
this is the best phone i have seen . 	1
the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks .	0
the fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .	0
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . 	1
i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective .	0
the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .	1
thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place .	1
took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 	1
even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half-way like this product if it kept it 's promise ; the ability to store 1500 songs .	0
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 	0
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 . 	0
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included . 	1
i can 't smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby ) .	1
4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 	0
the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print / share button don 't have a nice click .	0
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . 	1
as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec .	0
also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and / or the process of updating internet security .	0
the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs . 	1
great features .. . 	1
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train . 	1
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .	1
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .	1
the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market .	1
they are not wowable good . 	0
this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there .	0
i have not been disappointed with my purchase . 	1
recenly the variable speed control went out .	0
so far the software for the pc works easily . 	1
4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . 	0
software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it , it does the job well .	0
i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipaq 4155 .	1
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .	1
battery non-issue .	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website . 	1
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . 	1
very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures .	1
what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems !	0
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion . 	1
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 	1
1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 	0
it holds plenty of songs .	1
the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true ' world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from cingular ) replaces it w / 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .	1
overall , this router seems like a reasonably priced product th !	1
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly . 	1
even did while daughter sleep and no noise !	1
its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint .	0
the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so .	0
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried .	1
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it . 	1
why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ?	1
well , my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1 / 2 years .	0
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . 	1
what the hell is wrong with this thing . 	0
i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help .	0
you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . 	0
one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like . 	0
i love this camera !	1
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . 	1
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . 	0
let the champ win you over !	1
if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to .	0
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! ! 	1
track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly catergorized into the zen .	1
unfortunately i was wrong .	0
dependability : i 've seen no glitches .	1
- very long-lasting battery life 	1
feels solid in hand . 	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 	1
if you think you are saving $ 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $ 40 less than a makita .	0
it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .	1
the only disappointment so far has been battery life .	0
simple to use and hook up . 	1
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent . 	1
the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers . 	0
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 	0
i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .	1
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 	1
i upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .	1
the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem .	0
frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used .	1
do not buy this product -- 	0
after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem .	0
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons . 	0
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset . 	1
there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .	1
also love waking up to music with attached speakers . 	1
my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . 	0
i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen .	0
i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size .	1
there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it .	1
four megapixels is great . 	1
was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an imac .	0
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 	0
one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where softmodem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well .	1
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . 	1
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . 	0
unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 	0
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . 	1
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used . 	1
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . 	1
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 	0
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . 	1
most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options ... like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing .	0
c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said 	0
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . 	1
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 	1
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button . 	0
i tried to play the song three times , with no success . 	0
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned thier customers .	0
i own this phone for about 6 months now , i have used the following features : bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook , transfer files ( movies , songs ) , i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes .	1
then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not .	0
downloads are a snap and quick . 	1
best in class .	1
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .	1
the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 % or so .	0
with one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on ( i own the ir remote , icq and a few others ) , the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t-mobile that can claim such a distinction .	1
the card basically installed itself and the " install wizard " on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) .	1
norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer .	0
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 	1
the sliding latch is does not stay in place .	0
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . 	1
however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .	0
for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that .	0
i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so !	0
i love the features , the interface , the size ( the screen is a delight ) , the camera ( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me ) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc .	1
handsfree future is good , but not too exciting .	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . 	1
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price . 	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 	0
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! 	1
the 6600 has more ameneties than most - world phone , camera ( vga / zoom / night mode / timer ) , video ( w / audio & zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more .	1
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry !	0
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table .	0
i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags .	1
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing . 	0
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase . 	0
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities . 	1
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . 	1
i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i 've found the freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone .	1
touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct . 	1
don 't use them , so i delete them for addtl space .	0
* holds a lot of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers !	1
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 	1
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .	1
i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason : to keep the zen micro charged .	0
the performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars , but the linksys documentation and support is so poor that i can only give it 4 .	0
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . 	0
the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately .	0
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .	0
they are extremely convient and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i-tunes , which provides qulity music at low prices .	1
i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad .	1
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand . 	1
too costly and not efficient if you ask me !	0
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .	1
i went out and got the canon today .	1
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 	1
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slooooooooow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely !	0
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible . 	0
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any . 	1
i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless-g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product .	1
if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders . 	0
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . 	0
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store . 	1
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .	1
also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable .	0
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it . 	1
the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer .	0
it has plenty of power .	1
: ! ok , score 7.0 oh yes , the newest color of this phone is quite cool .	1
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model . 	1
it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon .	1
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s . 	1
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .	0
basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help .	0
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .	0
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car . 	1
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv . 	1
i found best results in most situation with manual / center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .	1
features : click wheel to navigate ; ability to work with windows or mac ; optional backlighting ( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ) ; ability to download pda info ; automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer .	1
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time . 	1
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . 	0
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's . 	1
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well . 	1
the extra gb of hardrive space , removeable battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .	1
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! 	1
the champ works great .	1
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing . 	1
after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . 	0
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .	0
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of unstalling ( or uninstalling ) them individually .	0
the screen 's large and easily read . 	1
my experience with installation was quite good .	1
so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? ? ? this seems academic to me .	0
some more manual control would have been nice .	0
again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .	0
we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason . 	0
it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . 	1
what a junk . 	0
we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great .	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . 	0
the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .	1
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 	0
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . 	1
mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti-virus 2002 & personal firewall 2002 first ) .	1
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 	0
the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use .	0
- large easy readable screen 	1
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities . 	1
night mode is clear as day . 	1
great camera . 	1
all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price .	1
it has many great features and very few bad ones . 	1
also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast .	1
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 	0
this product is a lifesaver ! !	1
the dvd player is fine . 	1
2 . you still have to clean the thing ! !	0
the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot .	1
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography . 	1
very annoying .	0
it works well with my voip adapter , which is also a linksys .	1
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . 	1
a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . 	0
my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of " brick . " *	0
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . 	1
despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) ... does more than most ... does it well ... is dependable .	1
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . 	0
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! 	1
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .	1
there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10-20gb , the rio karma , and the iaudio x5 have fm tuners .	0
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 	1
that 's a rare and valuable feature . 	1
it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 	0
we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it !	1
i must add to the dismay / delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .	1
if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .	1
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 	1
creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast .	1
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .	1
5.the camera installed on this phone is awesome .	1
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .	1
first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . 	0
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player .	0
transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .	1
i did it and it was worse the second time around ... unbelievable .	0
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date . 	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 	1
the buttons are rather stiff .	0
the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches .	0
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player . 	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . 	1
3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card	0
i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router .	1
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 	1
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . ) 	1
i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it .	0
it plays everything , even vcd 's . 	1
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo . 	1
at 128 the songs sound very good .	1
all-in-all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use .	1
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches .	0
nagatives of the player itself : you need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player .	0
customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . 	0
when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck !	0
pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? 	0
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . 	0
all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand . 	1
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . 	1
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on . 	1
you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ) .	0
but this camera is great ! 	1
i have never had an odor problem !	1
apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone . 	0
nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them . 	1
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .	0
the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . 	0
video output stopped workin . 	0
i do give create to creative for their attractive design .	1
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton . 	1
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there . 	1
i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and nav 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result ... junk software .	0
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . 	0
secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily useable on the go .	0
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up .	1
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used . 	1
i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ) .	1
it 's as though nokia has segregated 90 % of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 % for the day to day use .	0
i love this pail !	1
there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the " knowledge " database at linksys.com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own .	0
as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast ... about one or two seconds per song .	1
the remote is a little hard to understand . 	0
this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 !	0
if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else .	0
i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it .	1
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent . 	1
i can not find a carrier for this phone i like , end up just tossing it in my purse .	0
if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w / the diaper genie .	1
when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money .	1
1 no direct firewire to the camera . 	0
after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings .	0
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . 	0
2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . 	0
to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc .	0
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . 	1
on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well .	1
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much . 	1
i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this prduct seems to work very well so far .	1
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain . 	1
the included memory card is too small . 	0
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . 	0
stay away from this junk .	0
their website had a download that helped remove those , although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the " programs " directory .	1
the power is incredible , it cut through mdf and plywood like butter .	1
it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed , doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it .	1
it takes great pictures . 	1
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) . 	1
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) . 	1
cons - difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor .	0
i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ! .	1
when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked-- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless .	0
this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . 	1
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything . 	1
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough . 	1
3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 	0
the only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky .	0
t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ?	1
it is slow to initially start up , but once it 's turned on , i 've never had any complaints about the speed .	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . 	0
a bit dissapoitnd on that !	0
on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software !	0
this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment .	0
only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet . 	0
compatability with other devices is excellent too ; i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with * anyone 's * mixed mode ) .	1
it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills .	1
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .	1
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! 	1
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 	0
the phones are awesome . 	1
the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .	1
the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .	1
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! 	1
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 	0
the startup time , quality of pictures and videos is outstanding .	1
1 . the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find !	1
also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls .	0
for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .	0
the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .	1
screen review could be better .	0
it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break .	1
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there . 	1
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .	0
many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks .	1
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect .	0
problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad .	0
for the price and features it is really good . 	1
you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone .	1
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .	1
there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .	1
the battery life can 't be very long ; let 's not be greedy .	0
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective . 	1
as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , ' creative mediasource organizer ' .	1
i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho ) .	1
the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal .	1
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery 	1
great quality picture and features . 	1
5- excelent software package .	1
when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing ... it 's tiny !	1
it fits in your pocket .	1
the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful .	0
simple and it works !	1
it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer !	1
extremely convenient . 	1
only con i can think of is no camera ... . 	0
2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .	1
as for the zen micro : \ cons : i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front .	0
all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional .	0
the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but i was wrong !	1
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it . 	1
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2,5 !	1
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice . 	1
3 ) the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control .	1
no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications .	0
we are overall pleased with product . 	1
i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .	1
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too . 	1
some dvd 's i rented would not play . 	0
remember , this phone uses an operating system - symbian ... and it 's feature-rich w / 65k colors .	1
i forgot , the case does n't fit . 	0
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod . 	1
one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .	0
strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish .	1
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . 	0
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio . 	1
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 	0
it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is .	1
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies . 	1
unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset .	0
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always . 	1
the flaw is inside the zen .	0
i treat the battery well and it has lasted . 	1
it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! 	0
i tried called apex cust service , no help . 	0
the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly .	1
cons breaks easily .	0
the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle .	1
i love the slim design ; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky .	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 	1
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it . 	0
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . 	1
i am getting better speeds on all my web programs .	1
* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window . 	0
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on . 	0
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix . 	1
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings .	1
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .	1
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional . 	1
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured . 	0
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it . 	0
this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . 	1
i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest .	1
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .	0
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored . 	1
and it is extremely well-priced for what you 're getting .	1
pick your favorite color and buy it .	1
the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .	1
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . 	1
and supply those stupid white headphones .	0
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .	0
after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .	1
a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .	1
i have set up it 's pda features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather , mapquest maps / directions into it , which is great .	1
you can " disable " some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled--they 're still there and running .	0
everything i wanted ! the apple ipod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason .	1
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue . 	0
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either . 	1
- outstanding signal reception 	1
it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . 	0
i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers ... not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod theives here in nyc .	0
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) . 	1
unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . " 	0
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 	0
my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not " whine " during video , and my pictures are razor sharp .	1
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal . 	1
i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. . 	1
i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills .	1
i really love this phone ...	1
sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application .	0
this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .	1
the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customisable as well .	0
i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement . 	1
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . 	1
long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod !	1
battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times ... the camera / battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .	0
the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually .	0
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera . 	1
its also smaller , and gets more looks .	1
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; 	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day . 	0
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all . 	1
luckly , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! it is indeed worth nothing .	1
apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini .	0
the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . 	1
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy . 	1
i have an ipod and it is a great buy .	1
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). 	0
just point and shoot and the photos were great . 	1
with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .	1
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :	1
another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers .	1
i see many other reviews that say the same .... stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone !	0
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad . 	1
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . 	1
do not buy any home version of norton anything .	0
having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . 	1
as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .	1
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 	1
so far , the anti-spam feature seems to be very good .	1
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying . 	0
this player seems to work fine with everything else . 	1
p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? 	0
comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router .	1
this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .	1
i highly recommend this !	1
i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . 	0
the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple-approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time .	1
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there : 	0
it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why . 	0
i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements .	1
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .	0
the movie mode is also working great . 	1
seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " . 	0
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much . 	0
first of all , i 've never been big on earbuds - they 're just not that comfortable .	0
i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .	1
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm . 	0
it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . ) 	0
also , the lens cap design is flawed . 	0
i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money .	1
the screen is quite big ( between all handphone ) , but the just about 65000 color .	1
3 . the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface .	1
advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 	1
3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files . 	0
the touch pad is over-sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive .	0
have used it frequently and have had no problems . 	1
the included software removes any red eye easily .	1
its quiet . 	0
the ! sound quality is great .	1
i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it .	1
just the home version of norton internet / av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .	0
the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 	0
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming . 	0
5 . the price is right .	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . 	0
because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unreplacable 18 month battery .	0
ying to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best .	1
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera . 	1
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . 	1
fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .	1
this camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat .	1
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 	0
they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great .	1
there was neither picture nor sound . 	0
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 	1
the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced .	1
the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .	1
if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice .	1
and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1.5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge .	1
firewire & usb2.0-- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with autosync .	1
combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i 'm really happy .	1
the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are : one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well .	0
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner . 	1
i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the " sliding wrench " which comes on the router .	0
this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it .	1
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price . 	1
while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more ... without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .	1
the software sucks . 	0
1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 	0
the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription !	1
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller .	1
i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick .	1
give each friend a different ringtone .	1
the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network .	0
the sound is very nice .	1
while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) .	0
i never get dropped calls .	1
the price / performance looked just right . 	1
long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot .	0
the scrol bar agian takes some getting used to .	0
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .	1
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . 	1
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .	1
i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while .	0
buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my grany .	0
built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .	1
the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro-adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare .	1
the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch .	1
great phone , i 'd buy another . 	1
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse . 	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . 	0
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless . 	1
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $ 30 per incident .	0
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use . 	1
i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use .	1
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod . 	1
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the ' home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .	0
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use . 	1
my opion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has exelent range , holds a teady connection , hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now .	1
the included earbuds were uncomfortable . 	0
this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .	0
in short - nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly .	0
i occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode ) .	0
if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design .	1
i thought given all the " 10 " reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey .	0
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it . 	1
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone .	1
the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere .	1
it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70 % of my calls using it .	0
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . 	0
i love the camera .	1
b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 	0
this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 	1
i like the speed control .	1
i think it 's great .	1
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . 	0
the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap .	1
and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills .	1
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : 	1
decent battery-- on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock .	1
there is no comparison , the chanp is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .	1
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; 	1
i love my new nomad , its great ! 	1
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . 	1
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . 	1
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 	1
capacity is not a problem here .	1
the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480 .	0
audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions .	1
the size is tiny , which i love .	1
nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .	0
it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside .	1
5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! 	0
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it . 	1
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot . 	1
my only significant complaint is sound quality . 	0
it wo n't play all of my movies . 	0
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .	1
the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved .	0
is not as intuitive as i would like .	0
we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $ 6.00 and they work great .	1
no need for deodorizers .	1
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 	1
drops and strong signals even from the backyard .	1
this holds alot and does not take up alot of space .	1
- speakerphone 	1
but for what i do use it is perfect . 	1
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 	0
however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro .	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 	0
if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else .	1
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance .	0
i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! 	1
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .	0
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 	0
once again it won 't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians .	0
well , it was nice while it lasted . 	1
i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen .	1
i love this player . 	1
this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to :	1
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 	1
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping . 	1
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices . 	1
pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .	1
the height adjustment works well- not perfect .	1
if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen .	1
the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera .	0
overall an excellent phone . 	1
after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support .... they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful .	0
everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .	1
i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say iabsolutely love it .	1
battery : compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around .	0
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . 	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . " 	0
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing . 	0
they didn 't know what the problem could be .	0
i use the router with a 3 1 / 2in raised panel bit with no problems .	1
4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 	0
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 	1
first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made .	0
but not good enough for me .	0
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . 	1
3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . 	0
if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' properietary set-up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i.e. napster ) is down right wrong .	0
it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go !	1
also , some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files , whereas the ipod does not .	0
it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems .	1
i am very pleased with my purchase .	1
on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase .	1
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist . 	1
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .	1
the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject .	0
so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand .	1
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .	0
overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; )	1
it 's worth it . 	1
compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops . 	1
i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk : it 's allways in my shist pocket .	1
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .	0
also , you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue , dammit ! but itunes is about as good as anything .	1
norton support is completely pathetic .	0
you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .	1
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 	0
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional . 	1
i got it to use with the new $ 5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .	1
the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating .	1
a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 	0
the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate .	1
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor !	1
this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation .	1
the moveable lcd screen is great . 	1
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! 	1
bluetooth does not work on this phone .	0
especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications ) .	1
the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have .	0
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . 	0
) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors . .	1
like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error - it was not .	0
overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect .	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again . 	0
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! 	1
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range . 	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 	1
my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor .	0
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " . 	0
i am enjoying my phone a lot .... 	1
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 	0
having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal .	1
creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories .	1
7 . have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone .	1
( ... ) like most soho routers , it has nearly non-existant logging .	0
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( grrrrrr ! )	0
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds . 	0
the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera .	1
in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus .	1
creative labs customer support website is useless . 	0
this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time .	1
the gprs web access is sloooooooooooooow !	0
even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do .	0
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great .	1
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) ...	0
this is really a nice diaper pail .	1
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .	1
i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service ... and saw no improvement .	0
i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . 	0
i love the bluetooth ; easy to use with a wireless jabra headset .	1
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . 	1
if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one . 	1
i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it .	0
way to go apple !	1
exposure compensation in 1 / 3 stop increments ( i leave it set on + 1 / 3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .	1
since then , i have not found one major problem with it .	1
the box included a little polyester , pull-string bag , ( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in ) and tries to pass it off as the case .	0
i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the digital rebel .	0
( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work afterwards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked .	0
everything else about the camera is great . 	1
and so far , i 've been very pleased . 	1
a lot of " fragments " were left in the registry , and it the norton system folders .	0
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! 	1
difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . 	0
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad . 	0
the ss body is wonderful , feels high-quality .	1
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 	0
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . 	1
overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occassion .	0
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily . 	1
shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking .	0
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .	1
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 	1
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . 	1
great colors , pictures and white balance . 	1
overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .	1
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either ! 	0
it is mindless to operate .	1
mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 	0
i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability .	1
it 's not the heaviest around ( i think porter-cable has that distinction ) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation .	0
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .	0
it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .	1
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .	1
the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing !	0
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s / w worked well to connect .	1
the depth adjustment was sloppy .	0
i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior .	1
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . 	1
i just bought this player today and i already love it . 	1
camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution .	1
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 	0
the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good jasada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results .	1
i 've had nothing but good luck with t-mobile .	1
es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now .	0
this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine .	0
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . 	0
so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work .	0
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera ! 	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm . 	1
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod . 	1
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote . 	1
yes , the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem .	1
i highly recommend this phone to anyone . 	1
3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 	1
fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player .	1
the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . 	0
- the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .	0
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . 	1
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 	1
a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy .	0
the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 	1
even the " shorter " battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way .	0
but you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars .	1
the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection .	0
the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company .	1
audio is excellent . 	1
a sony ericcson may be the phone for you ... but good luck finding one w / all the features & such a competitive price .	1
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser .	0
i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .	0
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone .	1
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 	1
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) . 	1
navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . 	0
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5 / 5 stars = ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! ( digital zoom only though ) ... but still ... ( my old one can 't do that ... you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip . )	1
i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .	1
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . 	0
you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved .	0
this one is full of features ( has bluetooth ) .	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . 	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use . 	1
the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change .	0
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power . 	1
the viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken .	0
the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots .	1
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet . 	0
my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag .	0
the new canon s300 is 33 % larger and 26 % heavier than the s100 .	1
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers .	1
the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it .	1
you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . 	0
i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to saythat i never had so much fun with a new toy as this .	1
i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out . 	0
i would put the hitachi up with the best !	1
but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working . 	0
i tried to do this by instinct and it 's not intuitive unless you are a network geek .	0
each of the 4 lasted less than six months . 	0
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it . 	1
looks and shape : i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool .	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them . 	1
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person . 	1
there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things .	1
i will never buy a creative product again . 	0
the sound is just fine .	1
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .	1
even on the low sensitivy level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track .	0
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . 	0
-user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website .	0
i have the black one and adore it .	1
1- small .	1
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and / or lots of features you would find in a pda .	1
4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 	1
the phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card ... and turning the phone back on takes a little while .	0
the dvd player just would't recognize them . 	0
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product . 	1
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof . 	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) . 	0
we use the cheap $ 1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around .	1
depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 	0
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with .	0
the lcd screen was very large and readable . 	1
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it .	1
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality . 	1
the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod .	1
each battery lasts about 10-11 hours .	1
linksys is more costlier than others and is a home / consumer division of cisco .	0
they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonics and sennheisers .	1
the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use .	1
when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! 	0
i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .	0
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . 	1
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . 	0
audio on video also lacking . 	0
you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call .	1
when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .	0
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line .	1
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . 	1
the more i work with it , the more i love it ! 	1
the light auto-correction is awesome . 	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring . 	0
don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .	1
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it . 	1
setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate .	1
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table !	1
it 's not my first choice in cameras ,	0
symantec should give us all a refund and apology !	0
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it . 	1
6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic .	1
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket . 	1
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on . 	0
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange . 	0
this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .	1
i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever .	1
i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on .	0
their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific .	1
this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! 	1
the phone is very light weight . 	1
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50 + mbs from my backyard .	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless . 	1
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . 	1
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . 	1
this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp + router workhorses .	1
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . 	1
i was fed up and turned to wrt54g because of its positive reviews , good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs. router [ + 2 ] # # i 'm happy to say that this router was exactly what i was looking for .	1
pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quietcomfort 2 set .	1
has a great helpline .	1
i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage .	0
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games . 	0
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . 	0
i am bored with the silver look . 	0
so , don 't buy this or upgrade .	0
the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless .	0
download it fast to your computer	1
the camera was a marvel . 	1
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate . 	1
norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff .	0
user interface : the software is simple and straight forward .	1
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun . 	1
a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 	1
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product . 	1
the player is smaller than you think .	1
8- buttons are little , but if you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch , you can deal with almost anything .	0
it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality .	1
to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem .	0
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 	1
we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it .	1
the speed is the same as dail up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up .	1
everything , so far , has worked flawlessly .	1
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc .	1
little to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues .	0
overall , i 've been very impressed with the player .	1
it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ?	1
its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it .	1
broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies .	1
the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splruge .	1
the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t-mobile .	1
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) 	1
this phone is a winner ... 	1
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison . 	1
transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 . 	0
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .	1
but that is good for me because symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers .	1
doesn 't have alot of good games on it .	0
it looks sleek and modern .	1
it works great . 	1
and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! 	0
i had no problems following their installation instructions . 	1
wo n't play a lot of discs . 	0
if you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you !	1
for the price it is a well spent investment ! 	1
perfect size ! beats the competition by leaps and bounds .	1
i prefer things that are simple .	1
i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone .	1
i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites .	0
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely .	1
iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed .	0
probably a great phone overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs .	1
it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges .	1
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .	1
1 . record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro .	1
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits .	1
another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads. charging [ -2 ] # # also note that it doesn 't seem to charge when connected to the pc , only when plugged into an ac socket even though they both connect to the single usb port on the player , so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music .	0
this thing plays everything i feed it . 	1
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing . 	1
6600 looks and feels nice .	1
they are a royal pain to install , and don 't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all .	0
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 	1
the bass treble the sound detail is awsome .	1
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .	1
when it 's working , it 's great but it is very tempermental . [ t ]	1
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria . 	1
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into . 	1
everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .	1
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . 	1
the touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .	0
oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy . 	1
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec / norton site .	0
after installation , which was very simple .... i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .	1
no one has ever come to my house and noticed ' diaper odor . '	1
it is hot enough to be annoying .	0
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 	1
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .	1
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful .	1
i 've since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! ! !	1
you 'll love it !	1
the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $ 135 !	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 	0
3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and progs ( why 'd u buy it then ? ! ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias .	0
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . 	0
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 	1
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . 	1
this dvd play is basicly junk . 	0
one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .	1
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics . 	1
so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .	0
all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad / zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies . 	0
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! 	1
unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation .	0
all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment .	1
i enjoy getting use to the touch pad .	1
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . 	1
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 . 	1
even viewed cds full of jpgs . 	1
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus .	0
the vibration is not top . 	0
but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me .	1
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots . 	1
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . 	0
after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files .	0
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . 	1
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever . 	1
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck 	0
i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions .	1
) -can 't be left in the car ... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long .	0
big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 " is enough	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results . 	1
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .	0
even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up .	0
this thing seriously is a good player though . 	1
crappy headphones . 	0
not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording 	0
the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great .	1
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; they just read what 's on their website and charge you $ 50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .	0
it also lets you remove songs from the play order . 	1
all in all it hasn 't been a bad product .	1
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists . 	1
overall : i highly dislike the ipod , even though the sound quality and design is above-average .	1
for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better .	1
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me . 	1
all in all , this is a wonderful device .	1
in a week of use i 've never had to reboot the router .	1
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit .	1
the sound is incredible ; very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , mids and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast .	1
second , it is incredibly easy to use .	1
- some features in the user interface 	0
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .	0
it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it .	0
these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable .	1
i have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes .	1
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman . 	0
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 	1
what an upgrade ! ! !	1
two : it has a removeable / rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re !	1
4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices .	1
all the good reviews for the sd500 are true .	1
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . 	1
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ). 	0
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images . 	1
this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .	1
i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point .	1
my first impression was positive . 	1
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .	1
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing . 	0
that 's when it went from oderless , to oderous !	0
i love the storage in this thing . 	1
the price compared to the ipod is great . 	1
there is no way you can talk with customer care about this .	0
this camera is bulletproof .	1
it seems like the software is just not responding .	0
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . 	0
but with a low price , comes lower quality . 	0
sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault .	0
the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera .	1
the panorama setting is unbelieveable !	1
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . 	0
wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .	1
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! 	1
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . 	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . 	1
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . 	1
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . 	1
such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in ... wrong !	0
i finally got a free support number for norton through my isp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .	0
speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks !	1
the " movies " last about 5 seconds .	0
overall i like it . 	1
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 	1
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . 	0
